# Trillo Project

This repo contains the files for a project that is part of the Udemy course:
> Advanced CSS and SASS: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!  
by Jonas Schmedtmann  

Trillo is a mock-up for a single-page responsive app for a travel website which uses advanced HTML and CSS for it's development. It was designed by Jonas Schmedtmann for the purpose of concentrating on the use of Flexbox in positioning sections and elements on a page.  

This repo contains my final version of this website which includes solutions to several challenges which were suggested by the instructor for further practice as well as a couple of new features I wanted to include. In addition I desired to provide additional functionality to the links contained within the "search hotels" drop-down list. I did this through the use of individual pop-ups which are activated upon clicking each respective link.  

In addition to the course material I used the following in my development process:

- Gimp 2.10 for image importing/manipulation
- Inkscape 0.92 for svg creation
- Codepen for testing flexbox layouts and various other ideas
